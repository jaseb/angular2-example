== Asciidoc setup and usage

The project uses http://asciidoctor.org/docs/what-is-asciidoc/[Asciidoc].

Generation scripts are from the Spring Boot project, and are used to create README.adoc and HTML 5 documentation.

https://pages.github.com[GitHub Pages] integration is not covered in this example.

To generate documentation run the following from the 'docs' directory:

[source,bash]
----
mvn clean install
----

This will generate HTML in the 'target' directory, and update the project README.adoc
